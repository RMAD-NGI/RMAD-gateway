# RMAD-gateway
The RMAD-gateway contain two NodeRED scripts. These are desiged to run on a Advantech-BB SmartSwarm342 gateway, containing a SmartMeshIP embedded manager, or a gateway based on the SmartMeshIP VManager. The scripts recive data from the RMAD-edge devices through the SmartMeshIP wireless sensor network, and parses these to JSON objects. The parsed data is both forwarded to Microsoft Azure (or any MQTT broker) aswell as displayed on the NodeRED dashboard. The dashbord can also be used to comunicate with the RMAD-edge devices during instalation and maintenence. The RMAD gateway script for the SmartSwarm342 also contain a real-time module for evaluating data from the edge edge devices, activation the digital output on the device, as well as sending SMS allerts, when an avalanch is detected.
